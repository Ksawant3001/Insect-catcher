Dynamic Insect Movement: Insects move randomly across the screen, creating an unpredictable and fun challenge.
Interactive Gameplay: Click or tap on the insects to catch them and earn points.
Countdown Timer: Adds urgency and keeps players engaged.
Stylish Visuals: Designed with CSS to feature vibrant insects and a playful background.
